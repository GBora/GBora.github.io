                       <p>Born and raised in Alba Iulia, Romania.</p>
                       <p>I took my first steps as programmer here at the Math-Informatics class of the "Horia Closca and Crisan" highschool. </p>

                        <p>I continued my education at the Technical University of Cluj Napoca, where I got my bachelor's degree in Automatics and Applied Informatics.</p>
                        <p>I was lucky enough to receive an Erasmus scholarship to do my final paper at the Munchen Technical University.</p>

                        <p>My first job as a professional programmer was at Softvision, an IT firm here in Cluj.</p>
                        <p>It was a great opportunity for me as I could learn real software engineering practices within the context of 
                        large projects.</p>
                        <p>I mainly worked with C# specifically ASP.NET MVC but I also did a little front-end development mostly Javascript.</p>

                        <p>I currently work as a web developer at Pitech.</p>
                        <p>Due to the rise of SPA's the front-end of most site has become complex enough that I spend most of my time working front-end with a great emphasis on Javascript.</p>
                        <p>I am also leveraging my command of Javascript on the back-end with Node.js striving for the capabilities of a full stack developer.</p>
